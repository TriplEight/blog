## Installation

1.  Install Docker Community Edition from the [Docker Store][]. Follow the
    instructions for your specific operating system.
1.  Sign up for a free [GitHub][] account, if you don't have one already. If you
    do have an account, make sure you can login with your username and password.

### Command Line Operations

You'll be using Docker containers throughout the tutorial to do your work. It's
best to keep two CLI windows open at the same time: one to run the command line,
and another to run your web server.

#### Command Line

1.  Start an interactive container:
    ```sh
    make cli
    ```

#### Run Django Web Server

This will start the Django web server in a container, and will behave exactly as
described in the tutorial.
